# Minesweeper

This is a minesweeper game for web that I developed during my first school term at VFS in 2019. 

## Pre requirements
To run this game app on your computer you will need wampp installed. 
Installation link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/

## Start
The following instructions will guide you through the process of getting the proyect in your computer and running up on a browser.

1. Navigate to your *www* folder located inside your wampp folder. If you installed wampp directly on your C: it should be under the route: C:\wamp64\www

2. Download the zip file or clone the proyect with the following command inside that folder
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AngieGE/Minesweeper.git
```
3. Add a Virtual Host for the proyect 
  3.1 Start all services on your local server and navigate to your *localhost* inside your favorite browser 
  3.2 Under Tools > Add a virtual host. I named mine "minesweeper" Filled in the required information and click on "Start the creation of the virtual host"
  3.3 Restart DNS. You can do this by clicking directly on your Wampp icon. Right click > Tools > Restart DNS

4. Navigate to your virtual host inside the browser. In my case "minesweeper"

5. Enjoy!
